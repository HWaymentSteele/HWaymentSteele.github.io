#### Solar Energy from Blackberries
With Dr. Mal Johal and Conner Kummerlowe, we [filmed a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hertoGXWtE) instructing how to build a solar cell using a molecule in blackberry juice! We partnered with a low-income secondary school to help create a simple and engaging experiment, and we have since gotten feedback on the video from all over the world!
