## Studying Self-Assembly in DNA origami

DNA origami nanomaterials hold great promise in fields ranging from drug discovery to nanoelectronics for their durability and tunability, yet their yield can be low due to off-pathway assembly.  An understanding of the thermodynamics of the assembly process would allow us to improve the yield and design more complex structures.  In this work, I studied one  design principle for a "DNA brick" system, using larger "boundary bricks" at the edges of structures, and proposed a mechanism of how this design leads to more robust assembly using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Understanding the neurotoxic effects of aluminum ions on cell membranes

Dissolved aluminum (Al3+) is abundant in our surroundings yet is known to be neurotoxic in acute doses, and chronic exposure is increasingly correlated with Alzheimers-like symptoms. In this work, I demonstrated that Al3+ ions cause cell membranes to adopt a gel-like structure and reduce their diffusivity, which is highly detrimental to essential membrane functions. I contributed fluorescence microscopy, surface gravimetric measurements (QCM-D), and molecular dynamics simulations in this work.
