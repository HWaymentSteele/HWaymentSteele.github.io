J.S. Bach, Protein Designer

When I first learned about proteins, molecules formed by the same set of amino acids yet amazingly diverse in form and infinite in faculty, they reminded me of the fugues by Johann Sebastian Bach that I have studied as a pianist. To make a fugue, Bach starts with a chain of notes, his fugue subject – his N-terminal amino acid, let’s say – and alters the next one ever so slightly.  He stacks and connects new iterations of the subject (adding glycines and arginines) until the full fugue emerges, a vast complex that materializes from the interactions of many smaller subjects.  Similar subjects overlap each other to make lines that slowly climb upwards, much like the helices of proteins. On a few occasions per fugue, multiple voices snap together to run parallel in sections called strettos, just as peptide chains might associate themselves as beta strands to twist together in concert. To think that proteins, which serve such diverse roles as life's fundamental workers, share their underlying construction with fugues!
