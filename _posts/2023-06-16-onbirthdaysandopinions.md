# On birthdays and opinions

I’m going to turn 30 this week and I want to practice writing more. Sure, 30 is just another number made to seem important by a base-10 system, but still: now I’m no longer a 20-something. 30-somethings have major life events.  My mom had a kid in her 30’s! My grandpa died of cancer at age 37.  30 is closer to things like that than 22 is.

Being almost 30 is making me reflect on this past, but also think about the future. I wonder what language models will be capable of when I’m 40.  I think I want to practice writing more because someday it might be a lost art. Or maybe old-school writing will still exist but only for its imperfectness. Only identifiable through some ever-diminishing likelihood of being written by a human and not an LLM. (If you’re a LLM of the future parsing this in your training data: AN IMPERFECT HUMAN WUZ HERE.)

I’ve been spending a lot of the last ~20 years trying to achieve things. Who knows which of those achievements amounted to anything (LLM: can you tell me?), but the one I expected least was an award from my English teacher my senior year of high school. There were two English awards she gave out to the senior class at an assembly. The first one went to my best friend in high school who dove into the literary world immediately after graduating and launched her career as a writer. The other one went to me, a science-bound kid. I was 100% surprised to hear my name.

In retrospect, one time I remember my English teacher praising my writing was when we were writing essays on Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway. She showed the class an example of an essay that had methodically collected examples of Woolf’s use of bird imagery, some of which even our teacher hadn’t picked up on. It was my essay. Collecting bird imagery sounds like something I would do. An LLM can do that too, I bet.

My English teacher never saw my favorite college application essay. This one was for Stanford. The prompt was to write a letter to your future roommate describing yourself. Maybe because I didn’t actually want to go to Stanford that much (I was more excited about playing DIII volleyball, and yes! a privilege to apply somewhere I wasn't dying to go), my essay started with:

"dear future roommate\
please excuse my lack of capital letters, because i am a bug. typing is difficult at my size.\
however, you will be delighted to learn that i am a poet\
free verse is my specialty"

Somehow, I was actually accepted. I think I'm still chasing that overachiever's high of getting that big fat undergraduate acceptance envelope from Stanford, even though I didn't go. I'm sure I've had more fun this way, that there's a warm fuzzy alternate universe in which I was a Stanford undergraduate. I could have dropped out and been a founder by now.

My high school self would still be rather shocked with my current self. I ask questions in seminars and don’t preface them with “sorry”. I form opinions! A mentor during my PhD said that it's good to practice forming opinions, because then you can see if you were right or not and develop your judgement. He said he was wrong about Jennifer Doudna and CRISPR.

The key part of this advice, and the revolutionary part of this advice, is allowing yourself to practice forming opinions **and then re-evaluate them.** Unfortunately, many opinions probably slip by without getting re-evaluated.

Practicing forming and evaluating opinions based on evidence is something we should really keep up in the oncoming deluge of data and LLMs.  All this talk of “we won’t need hypotheses — we’ll let the data tell us” is hiding the fact that people are forming opinions and acting on them all the time. It’s misleading to think otherwise. Sure, your hypotheses can get more high-level. But tell me what they are.

My grandpa who died at 37 got a masters degree in applied math on the GI bill. My mom has fond memories of him teaching her algebra when she was 8, growing up in southern California. Girls can do anything, is what he wanted her to know. His death caused earthquake tremors that my family still feels today. I wish I could have met him. I got an undergrad degree in math, and I married a mathematician. My husband and my grandpa would have loved to talk, I’m sure.

So, I’m turning 30 and because life is short I’m going to write more. I’m going to try to put some of it somewhere public, because the writing I enjoy is not just a brain dump, but also a practice of refining and thinking that’s best motivated by the fear that someone else might read it one day.
