title: The *Wunderkammer*: the Dawn of Curiosity in Europe
---


During my MPhil at Cambridge University, I served as a contributing writer to [BlueSci](http://www.bluesci.co.uk/), Cambridge's magazine for science writing. [Linked here](https://hwaymentsteele.github.io/images/wunderkammer.pdf) is a feature piece on the *Wunderkammer*, a practice in Enlightenment-era Europe to which we can trace many current philosophies on science and curiosity.
