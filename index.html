Hello! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://kernlab-brandeis.github.io/">Dorothee Kern</a>, funded by the <a href="https://www.jccfund.org/">Jane Coffin Childs</a> fellowship. 

  <br />
  <br />

In 2025 I will be starting as an assistant professor in Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

  <br />
  <br />
  
I aim to use deep learning in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy and other experiments to improve how we access the dynamical foundations of biology, and how we predict and design biomolecular function.
  <br />
  <br />
  
I did my PhD in Chemistry at Stanford, where I improved RNA structure prediction and stabilized RNA therapeutics with <a href="https://daslab.stanford.edu/">Rhiju Das</a>, and used deep learning to better parse protein dynamics with Vijay Pande.
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
Before that, I studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a <a href="https://www.churchillscholarship.org/">Churchill scholar</a>, and chemistry and mathematics at Pomona College.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
When not doing science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://HWaymentSteele.github.io/rowing">a boat of some sort.</a> 
  
<br />
