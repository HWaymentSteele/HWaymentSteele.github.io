  Hello! I'm a postdoc in the Shih lab at the <a href="https://www.wyss.harvard.edu">Wyss Institute</a>
  developing methods to scale up how we study dynamics in biology and how we detect ultra-low-concentration molecules.
  (The two are related! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_proofreading" >What?</a> )
  
  I did my PhD in Chemistry at Stanford, where I used deep learning to better parse protein dynamics with Vijay Pande,
  and improved RNA structure prediction and stabilized RNA therapeutics with Rhiju Das.
  
  Prior, I studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a Churchill scholar, and chemistry and mathematics at Pomona College.
 <br />

 <br />
When not thinking about science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele/">a boat of some sort.</a>
