<p>
  
  Hello! I'm a  <a href="https://www.jccfund.org/">Jane Coffin Childs</a> postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://kernlab-brandeis.github.io/">Dorothee Kern</a> at Brandeis University. 

  <br />
  <br />
  
I integrate deep learning, data science, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to advance methods to predict and discover protein dynamics. I ultimately want to be able to design enzymes with the same finesse as nature.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
I did my PhD in Chemistry at Stanford, where I improved RNA structure prediction and stabilized RNA therapeutics with <a href="https://daslab.stanford.edu/">Rhiju Das</a>, and used deep learning to better parse protein dynamics with Vijay Pande.
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
Before that, I studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a <a href="https://www.churchillscholarship.org/">Churchill scholar</a>, and chemistry and mathematics at Pomona College.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
When not doing science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://HWaymentSteele.github.io/rowing">a boat of some sort.</a> 
  
<br />
