Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student in Chemical Physics at Stanford. I like using statistics and physics 
to better understand biomolecules, and hope to further our understanding of proteins and DNA 
to be able to harness the fascinating processes of biomolecular self-assembly to create 
useful nanomaterials. <br />
 <br />
I'm invigorated to be an eager collaborator, a mentor for students, a writer, a traveller, a classically-trained pianist, and a rower working toward a sub-7:00 2K.  <br />
