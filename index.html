Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student in Chemical Physics at Stanford working with Rhiju Das. I 
  use methods from statistical inference and physics to improve RNA structure prediction,
  with the goal of someday making complex RNA machines like fast eight-bit adders a reality.  <br />
 <br />
   I'm also a mentor, a writer, and a classical pianist. When I'm not thinking about training predictive models, 
  I can be found doing high-performance training <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele">in boats!</a>
