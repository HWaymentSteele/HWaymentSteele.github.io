  Hello! I'm a postdoc with Dorothee Kern at Brandeis University. I'm interested in using deep learning to improve how we design enzymes.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I did my PhD in Chemistry at Stanford, where I used deep learning to better parse protein dynamics with Vijay Pande,
  and improved RNA structure prediction and stabilized RNA therapeutics with Rhiju Das.
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
  Prior, I studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a Churchill scholar, and chemistry and mathematics at Pomona College.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
When not thinking about science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele/">a boat of some sort.</a>
