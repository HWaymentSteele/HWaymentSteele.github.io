Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Chemical Physics at Stanford working with Rhiju Das. I use statistical mechanics,
  gradient descent, and high-throughput experiments to improve RNA structure models 
  and someday design the next generation of biomolecular computers.   <br />
 <br />
When I'm not training models, I can be found training <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele">in boats!</a>
