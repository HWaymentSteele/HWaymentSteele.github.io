Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student in Chemical Physics at Stanford. I like using statistics and physics 
to better understand biomolecules, and hope to further our understanding of proteins and DNA 
to be able to harness the fascinating processes of biomolecular self-assembly to create 
useful nanomaterials. <br />

I'm also a collaborator, a teacher, a science writer, a classically-trained pianist, and a rower.  <br />

Thanks for visiting!  <br />
