<p>
  
  Hello! I'm a  <a href="https://www.jccfund.org/">Jane Coffin Childs</a> postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://kernlab-brandeis.github.io/">Dorothee Kern</a> at Brandeis University. I'm interested in gaining a predictive understanding of protein ensembles, and trying to discover new biology by finding new fold-switching proteins.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I did my PhD in Chemistry at Stanford, where I improved RNA structure prediction and stabilized RNA therapeutics with <a href="https://daslab.stanford.edu/">Rhiju Das</a>, and used deep learning to better parse protein dynamics with Vijay Pande.
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
  Before that, I studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a <a href="https://www.churchillscholarship.org/">Churchill scholar</a>, and chemistry and mathematics at Pomona College.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
When not thinking about science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele/">a boat of some sort.</a>
