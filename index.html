Hannah is an assistant professor in Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her lab combines data-centric deep learning and 
  NMR relaxation dispersion to discover relationships between dynamics and evolution,
  and to make experimental measurements of dynamics more accessible and interpretable.

  Hannah majored in chemistry and math at Pomona College, and studied theoretical chemistry at Cambridge University as a <a href="https://www.churchillscholarship.org/">Churchill scholar</a>.
  She completed her Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford University with Vijay Pande and <a href="https://daslab.stanford.edu/">Rhiju Das</a>, using machine learning to tackle problems related to protein and RNA conformational ensembles. 
  She then was a <a href="https://www.jccfund.org/">Jane Coffin Childs</a> postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://kernlab-scripps.github.io/">Dorothee Kern</a> 
  and visiting researcher at Google Brain with Lucy Colwell. When not doing science, she can most often be found in <a href="https://HWaymentSteele.github.io/rowing">a boat of some sort.</a>
