Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Chemical Physics at Stanford working with Rhiju Das.
  I'm interested in developing methods to better understand Nature's complex RNA-based machines,
  like viruses, as well as learn principles to better design our own RNA-based technologies. <br />

 <br />
When not thinking about science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele">a boat of some sort.</a>
