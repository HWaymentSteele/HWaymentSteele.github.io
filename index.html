  Hello! I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.wyss.harvard.edu">Wyss Institute</a> working with William Shih
  to develop ultrasensitive diagnostic tools using DNA nanotechnology. I completed my PhD at Stanford where I worked with Rhiju Das and Vijay Pande.
  I'm generally interested in combining nucleic acid tools and advances in statistics and deep learning to discover more of molecular biology.

 <br />
When not thinking about science, I can most often be found in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hwaysteele/">a boat of some sort.</a>
