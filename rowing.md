I caught the bug for rowing while studying at Cambridge University, and was very fortunate to find
the [Bair Island Aquatic Center](https://gobair.org/) rowing community during my PhD. With their support,
I represented the USA in the World Rowing Coastal Championships in 2019 and 2021. 

2019: 9th overall in the Womens Coastal Solo

7th overall in the Womens Coastal Double

In 2019, I became the first woman to win the 47th annual bridge-to-bridge race held in the San Francisco Bay,
a 10-mile race that goes under the Golden Gate and the Bay Bridge.

Since moving to Boston, I've been training with the Riverside Boat Club Women's Sweeps team.
In 2022 we took 1st place in the Head of the Charles Womens Club 8+.

It is possible to smile sometimes while rowing!
