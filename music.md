The study of classical music gives us the rare chance to connect to emotions that 
span centuries of human experience.  I feel incredibly fortunate to have studied both science and music.

As I have learned scientific concepts, I find myself reframing them in the context of music and vice versa.
The repeated patterns of a protein alpha helix? Much like the structure of Bach's fugues.
What makes a piano line sound "musical?"
It's when performed music obeys some musical conservation of energy, harmonic potential
energy being conserved as it turns into kinetic energy of a fast moving line.
